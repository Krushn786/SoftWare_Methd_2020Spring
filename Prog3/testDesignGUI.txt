This particular program is made for users to make better choices.
Thus multiple options will be taken of if something is selected.
This will reduce human error, and guide the users to simpler version of the program!

There will be so may test cases not included from program 2 as we made are GUI with keeping human error in mind

If any student is added/removed and if it was done successfully than a message with success statement will print!

We have made sure that if any button was selected than we will disable the non related attributes!
Thus no human error!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------Test Case 2 (When List is empty and then Remove command is executed
                                                    or trying to remove when someone doesn't exist in the list!)

We have carried on the errors from last project! Some errors are inevitable thus every time a user tries to remove
a person when list is empty it will give an saying list is empty add before remove!

When a user try to remove someone who is not in the list it will throw an Exception saying user not found!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Credits:   ___(numerical value more than 0)

RadioButton->CheckBox: Select option from ("Instate->Funding","OutState->TriState","International->Exchange")
Select OutState
keep   TriState unchecked

Click Submit Adding
------------------------

* Note on the test case *
Doesn't matter if the student type is Instate, OutState, International however if the student exist in the database,
Then no-one can add the a student with same name, even after same or different attributes!
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------Test case 4 (Negative Or Alphabetical or Symbol with credits or funds will be error)
// Will throw IllegalArgumentException
FirstName: Peter
LastName:  Parker
Credits:   !1  (Symbol)
        OR 1 2 (WhiteSpace)
        OR  1  (WhiteSpace)
        OR 1S  (Alphabetical)
        OR -1  (Negative)

           12 will work and will process further

RadioButton->CheckBox: Select option from ("Instate->Funding","OutState->TriState","International->Exchange")
Select Instate
keep:   !1  (Symbol)
        OR 1 2 (WhiteSpace)
        OR  1  (WhiteSpace)
        OR 1S  (Alphabetical)
        OR -1  (Negative)

           1000 will work and will process further

Click Submit Adding
------------------------

* Note on the test case *
Negative numbers don't do any good in this program, and we could have ignored and corrected
this error with multiplying by -1 but we don't know what's in the user brain so we kept it as an error.

Anything other than numerical entry in either funding or credits -> will result in IllegalArgumentException
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------Test case 5 (Name Containing symbols and numbers will be error)
If either firstname or lastname contains any of the below String style than it will result in:
//IllegalArgumentException
(The string entered is 6 char long)
Wi1son(number)
Wils n(whitespace)
Wilso (whitespace)
 ilson(whitespace)
Wil$on(symbol)

//Will add Peter Parker successfully
FirstName: Peter
LastName:  Parker
Credits:   ___(numerical value more than 0)

RadioButton->CheckBox: Select option from ("Instate->Funding","OutState->TriState","International->Exchange")
Select OutState
keep   TriState unchecked

Click Submit Adding
------------------------

* Note on the test case *
It's common to have fancy username, and from my knowledge there are some names with symbols in it!
However we have kept simple names and no fanciness, thus any violation of the rule, and there will
be error thrown.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------Test case 6 (First alphabet of First/Last Name lowercase character will be error)

//If either firstName or last name contains lowercase alphabets such as below example
//IllegalArgumentException
peter
parker

//Will add Peter Parker successfully
FirstName: Peter
LastName:  Parker
Credits:   ___(numerical value more than 0)

RadioButton->CheckBox: Select option from ("Instate->Funding","OutState->TriState","International->Exchange")
Select OutState
keep   TriState unchecked

Click Submit Adding
------------------------

A I wilson Long 8 1000  // Will throw an IllegalArgumentException

A I Wilson long 8 1000  // Will throw an IllegalArgumentException

* Note on the test case *
For the purpose of sense we have asked to keep every First/Last name's first alphabet to be Uppercase!
We could have made to first character Uppercase if it was provided Lowercase, however the program was
getting really complicated. So we decided to keep things simple in code, and throw an exception instead!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------Test case 7 (credit limit, and fund limit (will be error if < 0)
                                                    Part-Time vs Full-Time)

tuitionDue = $5,637

Click Submit Adding
tuitionDue = $6,637
tuitionDueAfterFunds = $5,637
funds remaining = (1000-6637) = 0
------------------------

* Note on the test case *
As there are really no limits for funds in real life, so we kept it like real life, no limit!


* Note on the test case *
If the student has 0 or less credits then there is no point of adding them in the list.
Also if they are international student there limit starts at 9 rather than 0.

// Will add Peter Parker as InState(FullTime Student) Will calculate the funds enter
FirstName: Peter
LastName:  Parker
Credits:   16(numerical value more than 0)

RadioButton->CheckBox: Select option from ("Instate->Funding","OutState->TriState","International->Exchange")
Select InState
keep   Funding checked if -> funding amount numerical(1000)

Click Submit Adding
tuitionDue: $7,936
tuitionDueAfterFunds = $7,936
funds remaining = (0-7,936) = 0
------------------------

* Note on the test case *
The above statement have credit limit greater than 15 thus they will
only be charged for only 15 credits!
This were the rule set by Mrs.Lily Chang
